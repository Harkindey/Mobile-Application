### Get involved
There are many ways to contribute. Here's a few ideas to get started:
* Go through the Getting Started guide. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by opening an issue.
* Look through the open issues. Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help triage issues.
* If you find an issue you would like to fix, open a pull request. Issues tagged as Good First Task are a good place to get started.
* Read through the React Native docs.
* Browse Stack Overflow and answer questions. This will help you get familiarized with common pitfalls or misunderstandings, which can be useful when contributing.

### General
* Most important: Look around. Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. This includes formatting, naming things in code, naming things in documentation.
* Add trailing commas,
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)

### JavaScript
* Use semicolons `;`
* ES6 standards
* Prefer `'` over `"`
* 80 character line length
* Do NOT use `var` when declaring a variable

### JSX
* Prefer `"` over `'` for string literal props
* When wrapping opening tags over multiple lines, place one prop per line
* `{}` of props should hug their values (no spaces)
* Place the closing `>` of opening tags on the same line as the last prop
* Place the closing `/>` of self-closing tags on their own line and left-align them with the opening `<`
