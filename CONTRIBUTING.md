### JavaScript
* Use semicolons `;`
* ES6 standards
* Prefer `'` over `"`
* 80 character line length

### JSX
* Prefer `"` over `'` for string literal props
* When wrapping opening tags over multiple lines, place one prop per line
* `{}` of props should hug their values (no spaces)
* Place the closing `>` of opening tags on the same line as the last prop
* Place the closing `/>` of self-closing tags on their own line and left-align them with the opening `<`
